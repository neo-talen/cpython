# Compile Python from Source code

### Introduction

***Self-hosted compilers *** are compilers written in the language they compile, such as the Go compiler. PyPy used a python compiler.  
***Source-to-source compilers*** are compilers written in another language that already have a compiler. CPython used a c compiler.  
Another example of a cross-compiler for Python is Jython. Jython is written in Java and compiles from Python source code into Java bytecode. In the same way that CPython makes it easy to import C libraries and use them from Python, Jython makes it easy to import and reference Java modules and classes.
